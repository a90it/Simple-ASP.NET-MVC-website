# Simple-ASP.NET-MVC-website
This is a website I am currently making to practise what I have learned in Telerik Academy.<br/>
The main part of the website is a simple forum.<br/>
Implements two types of individual user accounts - admin and normal.<br/>
The website is still in development and soon to be hosted online.
